<p>I was cramming for exams these days so I thought this might be a good opportunity to note down a few tips on self studying.</p>
<p>Friends around me (including myself in the past few years) are actually facing trouble on self studying, especially when you had limited time and you have to pass an exam or whatsoever. Usually online tutoring would simply tell you what you should do instead of explaining how to do so.</p>
<p>However, I believe most of us would at least have a brief impression of what we should do - if I am preparing for an upcoming exam, then I should read textbooks and do past papers; If its purly for interest, then start from the topic that you are most attracted about, or start from the very first beginning.</p>
<p>The real point is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to effectively read a textbook, for instance, in a limited amount of time?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to make it become “my knowledge”?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><span id="why-are-we-learning">Why are we learning?</span></h1><p>There are many places to begin. However, it is important to understand our goals of learning.</p>
<p>Different people have different goals in learning the same thing. Take mathematics for an example. College students and elementary school students might both be learning “numbers”. But we all know that what they are learning is not the same thing.</p>
<p>This can be applied to other subjects. If a person is learning “purly for fun”, then they are free to start from anywhere they like. A more purpose-based learning, however, might require them to acheive certain ability of retrieving and interpreting the knowledge instead of just knowing what it is. Therefore, different strategies must be applied. So young kids learn to count, and college students learn to analyze.</p>
<h1><span id="what-are-we-learning">What are we learning?</span></h1><p>Flipped over the cover page, skipped over the table of content, and directly turn to chapter one - that’s what I used to do when I started to self study. I had no clue on what the textbook is talking about, so most of the times I really didn’t know what information is important and what is not.</p>
<p>If you notice the importance of table of contents, then you already have a higher starting point than me. The constraint of ignoring the TOC is that you don’t get to know the structure of a course. There are usually interconnections between chapters, and this is the first thing you may want to figure out (though some of them might seem a little odd). There is always a hidden logic lying under the structure of a textbook. A series of questions might thus jump into your head, “why is ‘cell’ in front of ‘tissues’?” “What can we learn from the history of psychology?” “What is economics trying to explain?”…</p>
<p>Well, you might give out more potential ones than these questions above, but the point is to always ask yourself, “what am I learning”. This provides you with a holistic view of the subject itself, so that you can chain the concepts up.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is that some people refuse to add their own opinions and interpretations during note-taking. Honestly, it is quite understandable - I am totally new to this area, how am I suppose to know if my opinions are correct? But this really doesn’t matter. Always remember that you have the perfect reason to correct the mistake at any given time.</p>
<p>Learning is different from revising, and the ultimate goal of learning something new is not to create a study guide that paraphrases and levels down the textbook. During the process of learning, your idea matters. This is the opportunity for you to build up an inner logic chain and integrate the knowledge into your knowledge system. If you are afraid of making mistakes, or you want to distinguish between the contents on the textbook and your own interpretation, you could always use different colors to denote them, or just use a pencil while notetaking.</p>
<p>At this point, I would definitely recommend to constantly check the notes before and correct or revise some of your ideas. If you ask a question on chapter one, perhaps you may find the answer in chapter five, and respond to the notes on chapter one. I like to think it as a way of communicating with the less knowledgable self. :D</p>
<p>In the following posts, I will start from more of a purpose-based perspective (like cramming for an exam) and discuss about how we can quickly grasp the information we need from a textbook. The ultimate goal is to quit <strong>“reading the textbook”</strong> and begin to actually <strong>“learn from the textbook”</strong>.</p>
